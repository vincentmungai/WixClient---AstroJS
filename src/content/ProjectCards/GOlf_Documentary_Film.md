## Project Overview

I had the privilege of taking on the role of Creative Director and Director of Photography for an inspiring Golf Film Documentary. This project focused on documenting the journey of a young Kenyan golfer, capturing his passion, challenges, and triumphs on the green.


## Experience

Working on this documentary was an incredible and fulfilling experience. Collaborating with Jesse, the talented young golfer at the heart of our film, was both inspiring and enjoyable. Throughout the shooting process, we shared many moments of laughter and learning. Witnessing Jesse's dedication and growth up close was a testament to the power of perseverance and talent. This project not only allowed me to bring my creative vision to life but also deepened my appreciation for the sport and the stories behind it. The entire team, from the production crew to the supportive environment at the golf courses, contributed to making this documentary a remarkable and memorable journey.
