## Project Overview

Our assignment at the prestigious Royal Nairobi Golf Club involved capturing the excitement and spirit of the Tannahill Shield week, which featured both senior and junior golf events. The stunning photographs were shared on social media platforms like Instagram and showcased on the club's website.

## Experience

Working at the Royal Nairobi Golf Club was an extraordinary experience. The ambiance was serene, the competitions were fiercely contested, and the people were delightfulâ€”plus, the food was amazing! As a photographer, it was a dream come true to film professional golfers and witness the highs and lows of the tournament firsthand. The event was even more special as the organizers turned out to be the winners, adding a fun twist to the experience. Additionally, Sigona Golf Club triumphed in the Junior Tannahill event, and I had the privilege of documenting their journey throughout the week.
